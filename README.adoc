= LED-Drive

A naively simple WS2812 LED stripe driver for the Raspberry Pi.

== Introduction

LED-Drive is a simple program that drives a WS2812-based LED stripe using Raspberry Piâ€™s SPI output. It sounds like an easy task, but there are actually a surprising amount of caveats to navigate.

=== SPI drivers

There are two SPI drivers on the Raspberry Pi:

- The Linux standard `spidev` high level driver
- The BCM2835 low level driver

The `spidev` driver is generic regardless of hardware. It basically
creates a bunch of `/dev/spidev?.?` devices, and let you do I/O on
them like on a regular file using `read`, `write`, and `ioctl` system
calls. The BCM driver is obviously specific to the BCM chip that is on the Pi, and it uses the GPIO pins directly (`/dev/mem` or `/dev/gpiomem`) to control the SPI. In LED-Drive, a high level http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/[wrapper] of it is used.

LED-Driver has implementations on top of both SPI drivers. However, due to the strict timing requirements (I think) of the WS2812 chip, only the BCM driver works (to a certain degree). The `spidev` driver never worked for me.
